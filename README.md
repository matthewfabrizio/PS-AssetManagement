# PS-AssetManagement

PowerShell Asset Management

## Overview

This module will gather information from a Windows system and write to a SQLite database locally.

PowerShell core is required. This will not work on PS 5.1 because of the use of the Join-String cmdlet.

## Disclaimer

This module is a personal project that most likely will not work all the time but is used to as a learning experience. Feel free to use however you'd like.
